    "Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\".\n",
    "A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\" \n",
    "    Output: ace\n",
    "    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"ace\" and its length is 3.\n",

    "    Input: text1 = \"abc\", text2 = \"abc\"\n",
    "    Output: abc\n",

    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "    Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.\n",

    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000\n",
    "    text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters."
