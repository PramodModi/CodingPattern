    "To calculate frequency, will use Hahsmap. Whenever, a value will come for stack, map will return the frequency of that value. \n",
    "Store the value in stack at the position of frequency. Since frequency start from 1, so let the first frequency be zero. Frequency will start from 1, 2, 3 ... That means, new heighest frequency will be new entry in the stack, that means if frequency is equal to length of stack, that means it is new highest frequency, will be appended in stack. If not, means some value would be there in the stack for that frequency, so append this value against existing frequency.\n",
