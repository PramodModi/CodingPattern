    "## Concept of Monotonic Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Monotonic Stack is a special kind of stack, which maintains its elements in specific order (increasing or decreasing).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Two types of Monotonic Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Increasing Monotonic Stack\n",
    "    A Monotonic stack is called increasing monotonic stack, if the elements in stack is in increasing order from bottom to top. Here every new element should be greater than or equal to top of stack, if new element is smaller, then pop the element from stack, till top element is smaller or equal to new element or stack is empty.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ex: array = [1,7,9,5,4,8]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Monotonic stack, while pushing new element:\n",
    "        MS = [1,7,9] pused, 1,7 and 9 as they are in increasing order\n",
    "        Push 5. 5 is smaller than top element so remove 9 and 7\n",
    "        MS = [1,5]\n",
    "        Push 4. 4 is smaller than 5, so remove 5\n",
    "        MS = [1,4]\n",
    "        Push 8.\n",
    "        MS = [1,4,8]\n",

    "   \n",
    "               create an empty stack\n",
    "                for each element in the array:\n",
    "                    while stack is not empty AND top of stack is more than the current element:\n",
    "                        pop the stack\n",
    "                    push the current element to stack\n",

    "  #### Decreasing Monotonic Stack\n",
    "    A Monotonic stack is called decreasing monotonic stack, if the elements in stack is in decreasing order from bottom to top.

    "    Usually, where you have to calculate newxt bigger or next smaller elment. Problem may directly ask the next greater or smaller element or while solving the problem you may have to calculate next greater or smaller element.\n",
